## Orlog Dice Game

## How to Play
This is a variation of the Orlog dice game. Players will take turns rolling six dice. In this variant, you always go first. The dice will have one of five symbols and a blank side. The axe and arrow do one damage to your opponent, while the catapult does two damage. The armor and shield each give you one health, while the blank does nothing. After your first roll, you may choose which dice you which to keep (or lock). The dice you don't keep will be rerolled. After the reroll, the results of your dice and your opponents' dice will be calculated. Whoever has the highest remaining health after damage is dealt is the winner!
